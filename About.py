    """
    The Smart Watch Data Analyzer analyzes sleep patterns, distinguishing REM, deep, and light 
    sleep stages to evaluate sleep quality and detect disorders like sleep apnea and many more. 
    Additionally, it continuously tracks heart rate data given, identifying abnormal patterns. In 
    emergencies where the heart rate drops below a critical threshold, it sends an automatic SOS 
    alert to predefined contacts, ensuring rapid response. By utilizing advanced data analysis this 
    project aims to enhance personal health management, offering actionable insights and 
    emergency support to promote better health and wellbeing.
